Hello, I'm Martín Suárez Álvarez, from Galicia and based in Barcelona. I'm a Biochemist and I'm currently studying a MSc in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona).
I have great interest in omics data analysis, statistics, immunology, and cancer biology, and now I'm trying to learn about single cell/spatial technologies.

I want this website to be a place where I can upload the things that I do, both in class and in my free time, as a way of tracking my progress and share them with anyone who may be interested :)
